User other sources if you need.
using these sources as reference create code for capturing screen on windows 10/11.
It has to be service, running in windows.
It has to save screen capture every second to a file (in future it will be a realtime translation, so we have to capture efficiently)
It has to work on login screen and in user seccion, as well as captureing  UAC question windows.

Use most simpe solution that can do all these things. You can use C++/Rust or combination

1. we need most robust and compatible solution. and you are not restricted by language
2. Jpg (or if it is simplier, png)
3. Yes. handle multiple monitors. Image of each screen has to be captured via \\.\pipe\rarus-scr\0, \\.\pipe\rarus-scr\1 where 0 - all screens in one picture, 1 - only first screen etc.
4. Do all needed action.
5. Code has to handle windows messages for start/stop and all neccesary for using in sc commands.


make full solution ready to compile. No any TODO or realize-youself sections. All parts has to be made ready.


Add storing current captured image into ñ:/temp/captures/YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss.ext

Give full compilation guide.
